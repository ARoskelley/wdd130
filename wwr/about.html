            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Raftable is a white water rafting company that was founded in 2005 by a group of outdoor enthusiasts who were passionate about sharing their love of adventure and nature with others. The founders were avid rafters themselves, and they wanted to create a company that would provide a safe, fun, and exhilarating rafting experience for people of all ages and skill levels.
                In the early days, Raftable operated out of a small office in a nearby town, offering guided rafting trips on local rivers and streams. The company quickly gained a reputation for providing high-quality service and personalized attention to each customer.
                Over the years, Raftable expanded its operations to include trips on more challenging rivers and in more remote locations. The company also began offering multi-day trips, including camping and hiking excursions. As the company grew, it continued to prioritize safety and environmental stewardship, investing in top-of-the-line equipment and working closely with local conservation organizations to protect the rivers and surrounding ecosystems.
                In 2015, Raftable opened a new headquarters in a scenic location near a major river, complete with a retail shop, rental gear, and state-of-the-art training facilities for guides. The new headquarters also included a restaurant serving locally-sourced, organic food, and a lodge offering comfortable accommodations for overnight guests.
                Today, Raftable is a well-established and respected name in the outdoor adventure industry, known for its commitment to safety, quality, and environmental responsibility. The company continues to offer a range of rafting trips and other outdoor activities, attracting adventure-seekers from around the world who are eager to experience the thrill and beauty of white water rafting.
